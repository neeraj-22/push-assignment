    Push assignment - Solidity event tracker for moments.NFT 
</h2>

The solidity event tracker currently listens to events emitted by an alt contract of moments.nft to the frontend using reactjs. This is further to be implemented on the main contract.

## Features

- Events can be used to log transaction details to off-chain web-apps
- This can be used to make the UI interactive
- The emitted details are saved to MySql database and can be fetched via REST API route
- Infura is used as the node provider

## Future Updates

- Pulling this to the main contract
- Integrating PUSH protocol to notify when an event is emitted 
- Enhancing UI
